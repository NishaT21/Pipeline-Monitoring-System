# Pipeline-Monitoring-System
Pipeline Monitoring System – Acoustic Leak &amp; Corrosion Detection: Developed a low-cost acoustic monitoring system using a 16-microphone circular array with GCC-PHAT-based TDOA for 360° leak localization. Performed resonance shift analysis to detect corrosion, validated using MATLAB/Simulink under noisy conditions.

## Overview

<p style="font-size:18px;">
Pipelines are critical to modern infrastructure, transporting essential resources such as water, oil, and gas. However, leaks, corrosion, buried faults, and gas emissions often remain undetected, leading to costly failures, safety risks, and environmental damage. Conventional inspection methods such as ultrasonic testing, radiography, and ground penetrating radar are expensive, intrusive, and not suitable for continuous monitoring.

This project proposes a low cost, portable, real time acoustic monitoring system designed to detect leaks, corrosion, and hidden structural anomalies in pipelines using advanced signal processing techniques.
