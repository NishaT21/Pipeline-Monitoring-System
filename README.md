# Pipeline-Monitoring-System
Pipeline Monitoring System – Acoustic Leak &amp; Corrosion Detection: Developed a low-cost acoustic monitoring system using a 16-microphone circular array with GCC-PHAT-based TDOA for 360° leak localization. Performed resonance shift analysis to detect corrosion, validated using MATLAB/Simulink under noisy conditions.
